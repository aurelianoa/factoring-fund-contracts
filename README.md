# Factoring Finance Smart Contracts

A comprehensive smart contract system for factoring finance using USDC/USDT stablecoins. This system enables businesses to factor their accounts receivable (bills) for immediate cash flow while providing investors with opportunities to earn returns.

## üöÄ Features

### Core Functionality
- **Bill Factoring**: Convert accounts receivable into immediate cash
- **Multi-Token Support**: Works with USDC and USDT stablecoins
- **NFT Representation**: Each bill is represented as an ERC721 NFT
- **Liquidity Pools**: Investors can deposit funds to earn returns
- **Automated Distribution**: Smart contract handles all payments and fees
- **Flexible Conditions**: Configurable fee structure per bill via Conditions struct

### Financial Flow
1. **Upfront Payment**: Bill owners receive configurable percentage (default 80%) of bill value immediately
2. **Bill Completion**: When debtor pays the full amount, funds are distributed according to bill conditions:
   - Upfront amount returns to the liquidity pool
   - Configurable percentage goes to the bill owner (default 15%)
   - Configurable percentage retained as platform fees (default 5%)

### Conditions System
Each bill can have custom conditions or use default settings:
- **Default Conditions**: 5% platform fees, 80% upfront payment, 15% to bill owner on completion
- **Custom Conditions**: Can be set per bill for flexible terms
- **Validation**: All percentages must be positive and cannot exceed 100% total

### NFT Transfer Control (via BillNFT)
- **Locked by Default**: All bill NFTs start in a locked state and cannot be transferred
- **Owner-Controlled Unlocking**: Only the contract owner can unlock NFTs for transfer
- **Re-locking Capability**: Contract owner can lock NFTs again at any time
- **No Operator Approvals**: `setApprovalForAll` is completely disabled for security
- **Secure Approval**: Individual NFT approvals only work on unlocked NFTs
- **Modular Implementation**: All NFT logic is contained in the separate BillNFT contract

### Security Features
- **Access Control**: Owner-only functions for critical operations
- **Reentrancy Protection**: Prevents reentrancy attacks
- **Pausable**: Emergency pause functionality
- **SafeERC20**: Secure token transfer operations

## üèó Contract Architecture

The system is built with a modular architecture for better code organization and reusability:

### BillNFT.sol
A standalone NFT contract that handles all ERC721 functionality and transfer controls:
- **ERC721 Implementation**: Standard NFT functionality for bill representation
- **Transfer Control System**: NFTs are locked by default, only contract owner can unlock
- **Security Features**: No operator approvals allowed, individual approvals only on unlocked NFTs
- **Modular Design**: Can be inherited by other contracts or used independently
- **Events**: Emits `NFTUnlocked` and `NFTLocked` events for transparency

### FactoringContract.sol  
The main business logic contract that inherits from BillNFT:
- **Factoring Logic**: Bill creation, funding, and completion workflows
- **Pool Management**: Investor deposits and withdrawals
- **Payment Distribution**: Automated fund allocation according to bill conditions
- **Business Rules**: Default and custom conditions for flexible terms
- **Integration**: Uses BillNFT for all NFT-related operations

### Fund.sol
A comprehensive fund contract that acts as both lender and debtor intermediary:
- **Multi-Investor Support**: Pools funds from multiple investors
- **Automated Offers**: Creates competitive offers for bill requests automatically
- **Profit Sharing**: Distributes profits proportionally among fund participants
- **Bill Management**: Manages debtor bill requests and payments
- **Access Control**: Authorized admin functions for fund management

### SimpleFund.sol
A simplified solo investor version of the Fund contract:
- **Solo Investor Model**: No multiple investors to manage
- **Authorized Access**: Only authorized wallets can deposit/withdraw funds
- **Automated Operations**: Automatic bill request and offer creation
- **Management Fees**: Collects and manages fees for the contract owner
- **Streamlined Design**: Simpler architecture without investor complexity

### Benefits of Modular Design
- **Separation of Concerns**: NFT logic separated from business logic
- **Reusability**: BillNFT can be used in other projects
- **Maintainability**: Easier to update and audit individual components
- **Testability**: Each contract can be tested independently
- **Gas Efficiency**: Optimized inheritance structure
- **Flexibility**: Choose between Fund (multi-investor) or SimpleFund (solo investor)

   ```solidity
   factoringContract.createBill(totalAmount, dueDate, tokenAddress, description);
   ```

2. **Create Bill with Custom Conditions**
   ```solidity
   Conditions memory customConditions = Conditions({
     feePercentage: 3,      // 3% platform fee
     upfrontPercentage: 90, // 90% upfront payment
     ownerPercentage: 7     // 7% to owner on completion
   });
   
   factoringContract.createBillWithConditions(
     totalAmount, dueDate, tokenAddress, description, customConditions
   );
   ```

3. **Receive NFT**: Automatically minted upon bill creation

### For Contract Owner
1. **Set Default Conditions**
   ```solidity
   factoringContract.setDefaultConditions(feePercentage, upfrontPercentage, ownerPercentage);
   ```

2. **Fund Bill** (Pay upfront percentage)
   ```solidity
   factoringContract.fundBill(billId);
   ```

3. **NFT Lock/Unlock Controls** (inherited from BillNFT)
   ```solidity
   factoringContract.unlockNFT(billId);  // Allow NFT transfers
   factoringContract.lockNFT(billId);    // Prevent NFT transfers
   factoringContract.isNFTUnlocked(billId); // Check lock status
   ```

4. **Emergency Controls**
   ```solidity
   factoringContract.pause();
   factoringContract.unpause();
   ```

### For NFT Holders
1. **Check NFT Lock Status**
   ```solidity
   bool isUnlocked = factoringContract.isNFTUnlocked(billId);
   ```

2. **Transfer Unlocked NFT**
   ```solidity
   // Only works if NFT is unlocked by contract owner
   factoringContract.transferFrom(from, to, billId);
   ```

3. **Approve Unlocked NFT**
   ```solidity
   // Only works if NFT is unlocked
   factoringContract.approve(spender, billId);
   ```

4. **Get NFT Owner**
   ```solidity
   address owner = factoringContract.ownerOf(billId);
   // Or use the convenience function
   address owner = factoringContract.getBillNFTOwner(billId);
   ```

### For Debtors

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file:
```
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here

## üìà Gas Optimization

The contracts are optimized for gas efficiency:
- **FactoringContract**: ~5.0M gas for deployment
- **depositToPool**: ~107K gas average
- **createBill**: ~378K gas average
- **createBillWithConditions**: ~380K gas average
- **fundBill**: ~106K gas average
- **completeBill**: ~90K gas average
- **setDefaultConditions**: ~42K gas average

## üîê Security Considerations

### Implemented Security Measures
- **ReentrancyGuard**: Prevents reentrancy attacks
- **Pausable**: Emergency stop functionality
- **Ownable**: Proper access control
- **SafeERC20**: Secure token operations
- **NFT Lock/Unlock Controls**: Contract owner can control NFT transferability
- **No Operator Approvals**: `setApprovalForAll` completely disabled
- **Locked by Default**: All bill NFTs start locked and require owner permission to transfer

### Audit Recommendations
- Conduct professional security audit before mainnet deployment
- Implement multi-signature wallet for owner functions
- Consider timelock for critical parameter changes
- Regular security monitoring and updates
